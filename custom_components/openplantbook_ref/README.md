# Plant Sensor Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration that provides plant care sensors based on data from the OpenPlantBook API.

## Features

- Connects to OpenPlantBook API to fetch plant care requirements
- Creates sensors for optimal plant care parameters:
  - Light levels (minimum/maximum lux)
  - Temperature ranges (minimum/maximum Â°C)
  - Humidity ranges (minimum/maximum %)
  - Soil moisture ranges (minimum/maximum %)
  - Soil conductivity ranges (minimum/maximum Î¼S/cm)
- Supports plant images as entity pictures
- Full UI configuration - no YAML required
- Device registry integration for proper organization
- Diagnostic support for troubleshooting

## Setup

1. Install the custom component in your `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Integration Quality

This integration follows Home Assistant's Integration Quality Scale and implements:

- âœ… **Bronze**: Config flows, unique entity IDs
- âœ… **Silver**: Entity unavailability handling, parallel updates
- âœ… **Gold**: Device management, diagnostics support
- ðŸ”„ **Platinum**: In progress - strict typing, async dependencies
